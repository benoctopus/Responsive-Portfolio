                        If life has taught me anything at all, it is that where you go is more important than where you start.
                    <br/><br/>
                        I began my adult life with very little direction, no finances, and an admission letter to a california state college. For the first few years, i took this situation and ran with it; However, i did not accomplish much due to a lack of direction. It soon became clear to me that in order to be truly successful, i would have to find something to chase, something rewarding that i could catch a glimpse of once and a while at the end of the road.
                    So instead of continuing my lengthy career of pursuing <i>nothing</i>, i set out on my journey to find <i>something</i>.
                    <br/><br/>
                        After a year or two of working customer service jobs and teaching guitar to children, I found that my own personal <i>something</i> was computer programming. It wasn't a particularly stunning revolution, as i have been working with computers and hacking on a low level as a sort of hobby since my childhood, but it was nonetheless essential for my own personal growth.
                    <br/><br/>
                        This bring us to the Benjamin Rose of today, once again working my way through the educational system. This time however, the light at the end of the tunnel shines bright. These days I am working hard to become a full stack web developer with the help of the UCD coding bootcamp and their awesome staff, which primarily consists of delving into the world of JavaScript and it's countless applications in the realm of the web.
                    <br/><br/>
                        In my free time, i enjoy teaching myself other programming languages and technologies as well as continuing my lifelong development as a solo musician. At this point in time you can catch me coding my own applications in Java and Python, or scouring the web for open source projects to which i may be of assistance. That, and trying to stay rad and write some face melting riffs for my up and coming EP.
